# Impact of COVID-19 on Flight Activity from January to July 2020
## Summary
This project evaluates domestic and international flight activity in the two periods of: 
* Jan - July 2019
* Jan - July 2020

We retrieved monthly data for international and domestic markets from the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transporation Statistics. The data has monthly summaries of passengers with origins and destinations of the flights taken each month and is only current through July 2020. For this reason, we limited our analysis to compare only January to July in 2019 and 2020.
